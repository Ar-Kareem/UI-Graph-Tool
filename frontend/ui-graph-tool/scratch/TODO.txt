 ~ Record basic telemetry (when the story is requested, etc) [on user login and on story update]
✔️ REDIS backend
✔️  Buttons to create graphs should be buttons to retrieve stories
✔️ Add annotator field
✔️ Make autosave (e.g. per story change, previous-next, …)


    show "story nr out of total stories"
    Only DAGs, reject changes that cause loops
    1 connected component

✔️  When adding a new node, default the connection to the last added node

✔️  add edge popup can choose two node numbers
