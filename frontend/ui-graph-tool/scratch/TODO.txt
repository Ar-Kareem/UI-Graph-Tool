TODO:
   (DB change) I’d also add buttons for edge labellingg
   (DB change) And a button for shape selection
   (DB change) Goto last
   (Q: how to highlight edge?) This is second order: a button to reverse the edge direction (and correct mistakes)

✔️ backend only saves on changes
✔️ telemetry on get story
✔️ Implement highlight nodes with 0-9 in keyboard
✔️ Prev/Next story with "[" and "]" keyboard shortcuts
✔️ Enforce DAG in graph
✔️ seperate view mode

✔️ (IMPLEMENTED TOP-DOWN LEFT-RIGHT TOGGLE BUTTON) Maybe a zoom button, so that sometimes you want to see an overview but sometimes you want a scroll bar at the bottom? Some graphs get really tiny
✔️ Could we limit the number of edges between nodes? At most 1 edge between any two nodes?
✔️ Could we have a keyboard shortcut for rename when a node is selected
✔️ A button to show a help page that displays the ekeyboard shortcuts
✔️ And adding in the username to the url so we can share links
✔️ A small bug: I typed in "recalled drone" and it displays as "recall_ed drone"
✔️ Can you change "n" so that when a node is selected it connects to that node, not to the last created node? And then unselects that node This is a lot faster than making the node, then disconnecting it, and reconnecting it
✔️ It would also be very useful to add another view-only mode where you see all of the graphs for a story, labeled with who made each graph
✔️ Search that is really a “goto”
✔️ Keyboard shortcuts (general and for the graph)
✔️ Add story id in the URL
✔️ Record basic telemetry (when the story is requested, etc) [on user login and on story update]
✔️ show "story nr out of total stories"
✔️  Only DAGs, reject changes that cause loops

✔️ REDIS backend
✔️  Buttons to create graphs should be buttons to retrieve stories
✔️ Add annotator field
✔️ Make autosave (e.g. per story change, previous-next, …)
✔️  Put the story above the graph (so the story doesn't move while the graph changes)
✔️  When adding a new node, default the connection to the last added node
✔️  add edge popup can choose two node numbers
✔️  number the nodes -> when adding new node pick number to attach to, no number then last
