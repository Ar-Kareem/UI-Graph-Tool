TODO:

I’d also add buttons for edge labellingg
And a button for shape selection
This is second order: a button to reverse the edge direction (and correct mistakes)

✔️ Keyboard shortcuts for next/prev story CAUSING DELETION IF QUICK
✔️  (IMPLEMENTED TOP-DOWN LEFT-RIGHT TOGGLE BUTTON) Maybe a zoom button, so that sometimes you want to see an overview but sometimes you want a scroll bar at the bottom? Some graphs get really tiny
✔️  Keyboard shortcuts for next/prev story
✔️  Could we limit the number of edges between nodes? At most 1 edge between any two nodes?
✔️  Could we have a keyboard shortcut for rename when a node is selected
✔️ A button to show a help page that displays the ekeyboard shortcuts
✔️ And adding in the username to the url so we can share links
✔️  A small bug: I typed in "recalled drone" and it displays as "recall_ed drone"
✔️ Can you change "n" so that when a node is selected it connects to that node, not to the last created node? And then unselects that node This is a lot faster than making the node, then disconnecting it, and reconnecting it
    It would also be very useful to add another view-only mode where you see all of the graphs for a story, labeled with who made each graph

    Goto last
✔️ Search that is really a “goto”
✔️ Keyboard shortcuts (general and for the graph)
✔️ Add story id in the URL
✔️ Record basic telemetry (when the story is requested, etc) [on user login and on story update]
✔️ REDIS backend
✔️  Buttons to create graphs should be buttons to retrieve stories
✔️ Add annotator field
✔️ Make autosave (e.g. per story change, previous-next, …)


✔️ show "story nr out of total stories"
✔️  Only DAGs, reject changes that cause loops
✔️  Put the story above the graph (so the story doesn't move while the graph changes)
✔️  When adding a new node, default the connection to the last added node

✔️  add edge popup can choose two node numbers
✔️  number the nodes -> when adding new node pick number to attach to, no number then last
✔️  FIX ERROR ADD EDGE TO LAST NODE
